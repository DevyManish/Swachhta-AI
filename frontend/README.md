# üñ•Ô∏è Swachhta Monitoring AI Frontend

Welcome to the frontend of the **Swachhta Monitoring AI** project! This interface serves as part of a holistic solution designed to monitor cleanliness and green LiFE (Lifestyle for Environment) practices, as implemented within the Department of Posts (India).

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The frontend component is built using **Next.js** and designed to provide a seamless user interface for monitoring, visualizing, and interacting with data collected for cleanliness and green initiatives.

### Key Features:
- Clean and responsive UI for displaying cleanliness data
- User authentication and session management via **JWT**
- Interaction with backend APIs to upload images, fetch analytics, and visualize data
- UI components powered by **Radix UI** for accessibility and styling
- Makes secure HTTP requests to the backend using **Axios**

---

## üèóÔ∏è Technologies & Tools

- **Languages**: JavaScript, TypeScript
- **Frameworks**: Next.js
- **UI Components**: Radix UI
- **HTTP Requests**: Axios
- **Authentication**: JWT (JSON Web Tokens)

## ‚öôÔ∏è How to Set Up and Run the Project

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
- Node.js 14.x or above
- NPM or Yarn
- Git

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine using Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/SwachhtaMonitoringAI-Frontend.git
```

### 2. Clone the Repository

Navigate to the project directory and install all required dependencies.

```bash
cd SwachhtaMonitoringAI-Frontend
npm install
```
### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a .env.local file at the root of your project and add the necessary environment variables:

```bash
# Add Uploadthing secret and appId to setup file upload https://uploadthing.com/ 
UPLOADTHING_SECRET=*****
UPLOADTHING_APP_ID=*****

# Next auth https://next-auth.js.org/configuration/options
# Run this command to generate a new NEXTAUTH_SECRET
# $ openssl rand -base64 32

NEXTAUTH_URL = http://localhost:3000
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=*****

# Go to GitHub and setup the OAuth configuration
# https://next-auth.js.org/providers/github#configuration
# https://github.com/settings/developers

GITHUB_ID = 
GITHUB_SECRET = 

# Add your backend API URL
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=<your-backend-api-url>
NEXT_PUBLIC_JWT_SECRET=<your-jwt-secret>

```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Once everything is set up, start the Next.js development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```
Or with Yarn:

```bash
yarn dev
```

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

- **JWT Authentication**: User authentication is managed using JSON Web Tokens. Upon login, the token is stored in the frontend and used to authenticate API requests.
- **Axios**: All API requests, such as uploading images or retrieving cleanliness analytics, are made using **Axios**, which handles HTTP requests efficiently.
- **Radix UI**: The project uses **Radix UI** for building accessible and customizable UI components.

---

## üß™ Testing the Application

You can test the frontend by logging in and interacting with the dashboard. All user data and interactions are sent via secure HTTP requests to the backend using **Axios**.

If you encounter any issues with authentication or data fetching, check your **JWT** setup and API URL configuration in the `.env.local` file.
